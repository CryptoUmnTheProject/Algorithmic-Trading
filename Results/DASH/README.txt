-Some things to note, the results aren't indicative of what you would get if you took this algorithm straight to market. A major flaw could be that the weighted average price we're looking at is the price from BTC to DASH, so it's not a good indicator of DASH's value compared to the dollar. Furthermore, the weighted average will probably be less than the buy price in real life, not to mention there are other important market issues that the algorithm doesn't consider (like volume).

Besides these issues, the algorithm is a good sample or template for what we can do with algorithms!
