Artificial intelligence is a very broad field of study but the kinds that I’ll mention here are natural language processing (NLP) and the kind that uses neural networks to identify patters in prices.  For Neural nets, TensorFlow is the best place to start and the easiest to implement; if you find that it’s a bit tough to understand, don’t panic.  All of this has been only recently created and discovered, and most of it is only looked at by PhD or grad students so we’re getting into some interesting territory but that’s part of the fun!To start, NLP is useful because it allows us to extrapolate meaning from reading files written by humans.  An example would be using some sort of algorithm or library to read through an article about a currency and deciding if the article is saying positive or negative things about said currency.  This is a little complicated and might not yield the best returns but it allows us to gauge how the market is feeling about a particular currency.  Some useful links to get started are (the first is probably the most interesting):http://allennlp.org/https://spacy.io/http://www.nltk.org/Beyond NLP, we can use neural networks to learn about markets and find patterns in the numbers.  To get started, I highly suggest looking through Andrew Ng’s free course on AI: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?authMode=loginTo get started coding with AI, the best place to start is with TensorFlow.  This is a good starting tutorial to get familiar with the platform.  You’ll have to download it first.  https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginnersIf you’re interested in learning how AI in general works, this is a good article: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/want-to-know-how-deep-learning-works-heres-a-quick-guide-for-everyone-1aedeca88076Some good resources if you want to learn more about neural nets, but they’re a bit more advanced: https://colah.github.io/
