This README contains instructions on how to run an algorithm on the SQL data.
The example I uploaded works by running over a chunk of data that I downloaded onto a flash drive.  You don’t have to use a flash drive but in order to run a similarly working algorithm, you should have the data downloaded somewhere.  The link to download this chunk of data can be found here (warning: this chunk is about 6.6 gigabytes large and represents about one month of data (August 14th - September 14th)): https://acm.umn.edu/~nathan/snapshot-1505512821.db

Once you’ve done this, you need to make sure you have python3 downloaded and ready to run (I use idle but pycharm should be able to run this too).  The easiest way to run the code from here is to open a new file in idle and to copy and paste the algorithm into this new file.  If you’re more familiar with how Github works, then you can gitclone into your own repository.

Once you’ve done all this, you have to change that address on line 11 of the algorithm.  This line tells the computer running the code where the chunk of data is on your device, so what you should do is delete the whole address (the part in parentheses) and input the full address of where you downloaded the chunk.  If you’re not sure how to do this, right click on the downloaded chunk and left click in “Get info” or the equivalent depending on what kind of device you’re using, and somewhere in the info it should specify the address in “Where.”  Copy the address into the part that you deleted on line 11.

In order to run the algorithm, in idle, click on “Run” near the “File” bar in the top left, and then in the drop down click “Run Module.”  Depending on your system, the algorithm will take less than 7 minutes to run with most of this time being taken by retrieving the selected info from the data chunk.  Feel free to change and test different parameters.
