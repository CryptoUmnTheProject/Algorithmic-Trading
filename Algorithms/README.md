# Important!
## Comments
If you want to submit an algorithm (you definitely should), then we also ask that you to add comments to areas where key logic is being executed.  So if you write x = 5 that's pretty self explanitory, but if you write some conditional logic that will execute a trade if true - then a comment should be added in the code to indicate to the reader when this conditional portion should execute.
